# Getting Started with Voyant Tools
In this workshop we will explore utilizing the Voyant Tools platform originally developed by Stéfan Sinclair to analyze various texts and explore how textual analysis tools like Voyant can help advance your teaching and research. The exploration that we do today will also help you begin to build a foundation for utilizing more advanced text analysis tools if you wish to explore further. 

## What You'll Do
1. Familiarize yourself with the Voyant interface and analyze a historical novel of your choice
2. 

## Why It Matters
Given recent trends in digitalization, there is a wealth of textual data available for analysis, both contemporary and historical. While textual analysis has long been used as a tool in literary studies, it also has important applications in a wide variety of domains ranging from the history of science to sociology. Using computational tools to analyze the written record can open up a wide variety of analytical avenues, including into understanding the nature of our own disciplines. Andrew Goldstone and Ted Underwood, for instance, analyzed over 21,000 peer-reviewed articles from *PMLA* in order to trace changes in the field of literary studies over the past 120 years. 

## Instructions
### Voyant Tools
For this workshop, we'll be using a free, web-based, open-source tool for text analysis. Originally developed by Stéfan Sinclair, Voyant Tools is currently led by Geoffrey Rockwell at the University of Alberta. It is one of the most accessible text analysis tools available and, because it is web-based and requires no special software, it is one of the easiest tools to begin to use for either research or teaching. While it is among the more basic text analysis tools available, it does offer some powerful analytical features and is useful for exploring texts and smaller *corpora*, or collections of texts, and serves as a useful gateway into the world of text analysis tools. 

## Options for Further Exploration
There are a wide variety of open source textual analysis packages that work with languages such as R and Python that enable everything from extracting topics and topical patterns to measuring sentiment within documents. If you're interested in exploring more, you can take a look at some of the following resources (many of which teach very well): 
- [Introduction to 
stylometry in Python](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/introduction-to-stylometry-with-python) on [The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/) by François Dominic Laramée. 
- [Sentiment Analysis for Exploratory Data Analysis](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/sentiment-analysis) on [The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/) by Zoë Wilkinson Saldaña. 

There are also great resources available for building corpora, including: 
- ITHAKA's [Constellate](https://constellate.org/) platform for academic articles
- [The HathiTrust Research Center](https://www.hathitrust.org/htrc) for historical books and periodical publications
- [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) for historical books that are no longer covered by copyright
